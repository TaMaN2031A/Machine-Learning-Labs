My role in the Assignments:  
Dimensionality reduction: My role was reading the data, creating PCA nad kernel PCA functions to reduce the data dimensionality. I also created the charts comparing the results.
Clustering algorithms: My role was reading the data, applying a spectral clustering algorithm. I also created the charts comparing the results.
Bioinformatics lab: They were indivdual labs.
